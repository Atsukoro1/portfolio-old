    <h1>What is DNS?</h1>
    <p>
        First, let's talk about what DNS is. DNS is a decentralized system to resolve
        domain names to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, it has more purpose but this is
        not important to know to understand this article. It is a very important part
        of the internet, without it, you wouldn't be able to access any websites by without 
        memorizing the IP address. DNS is an unencrypted protocol so it's possible to
        intercept and modify DNS requests.
    </p>

    <h1>What is encryption and how is it used</h1>
    <p>
        We will use HTTPS as an example, but this applies to any encryption. Encryption
        is a way to scramble data so that it is unreadable to anyone who doesn't have
        the key to decrypt it. When requesting data from webserver over HTTPS, the
        data is encrypted in process known as asymetric cryptography. The webserver
        uses a private key to encrypt the data, and the client uses the public key to
        decrypt the data. The public key is sent to the client when the client
        connects to the webserver, and the private key is kept secret. This is how
        HTTPS works, keep this in mind for later.
    </p>

    <h1>Why encryption matters</h1>
    <p>
        When sending unencrypted data over our network, it is possible for anyone to 
        intercept the data, read it and also modify it using Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. 
        Also our ISP can see what we are doing and sell this data to third party companies. 
        This is why encryption is a must for every protocol that sends data over the internet.
    </p>

    <h1>Is there a solution?</h1>
    <p>
        Currently there are two solutions to this problem, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over
        TLS (DoT). DoH is a protocol that sends encrypted DNS data over HTTPS with the requested
        data from the remote web server. DoT is an encrypted DNS implementation on it's own,
        and does not use any other protocol to transfer it's data.
