        Since there is no explanation for this challenge, let me do it myself.
        C.O.P was pretty simple challenge for an experienced person, for me it was 
        a little bit hard, but nothing insane. This will be a <b>step by step guide</b> about
        how I solved this.
    </p>

    <h1>Step 1 - Enumeration</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            First, let's look to Server HTTP header to see if there is some vulnerable version 
            of webserver running on this machine.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9XwByMXk/image.png" alt="logo">
        <p>
            Looking at Snyk's database for this particular Werkzeug version, it looks like the only 
            vulnerability here is with debug console (which is not enabled), so we must look somewhere else
            for the hint, there is source code of this application available for us to look at the HackTheBox website so 
            let's look through it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Step 2 - SQLi found</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            It took me about 5 minutes to find this extremely simple SQL injection in models file by
            easily escaping the apostrophe. We can influence this variable at "/view/[number]" route by
            changing the url path which is used for ID of specific product.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/dVcvJLDc/image.png" alt="obrazek">
        <p>
            This will be Boolean based SQLi so it will be little bit slow to crawl through data, you can
            additionally add "threads" parameter to enumerate faster but in our case it's pretty much
            useless. Let's run the following sqlmap command with asterisk symbol in the location 
            where product id should be to represent that this can be injectable.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VN3xmNYb/image.png" alt="obrazek">

        <p>
            Let's run this sqlmap command and look what we have inside this database.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d1wjFmcZ/image.png" alt="sqli">

        <p>
            There are 2 tables present in this one database, the first one contains
            product id, base64 encoded data and created_at timestamp. The second DB is only for
            sqlite to store user data. Nothing here can help us further continue, so the way must
            be somewhere else.
        </p>

    <h1>Step 3 - Python pickle RCE</h1>
    <div>
        <p>As the website content suggests, the the main problem here are "pickles".</p>
        <details>
            <summary>What is python pickle</summary>

            <p>
                A python library for deserializing and serializing data into object structure.
                In this case it is being used to serialize list.
            </p>
        </details>

        <p>
            Let's first look how the application process data using the pickles library to fully 
            understand how to attack.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/sFZ2K98/image.png" alt="template">

        <p>
            We can see that there is a variable with name "product" being processed in template, 
            it is being piped to "pickle" server-side function, this will be our 
            entry point that we'll attack. The method vulnerable to RCE in pickle is called loads 
            (as defined below), this function will decode base-64 encoded string and then unpack it.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h1>Step 4 - Obtaining the flag</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            In the previous step I described how I plan to attack the machine, let's do it now, here is
            my python script that I wrote to generate the payload.
        </p>
        <pre>
import pickle
import base64
import os

class Gen(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        # RCE
        script = "mv ./flag.txt /app/application/static/images/flag.txt"
        return os.popen, (script)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pickled = pickle.dumps(Gen())
    print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(pickled))</pre>
    <p>
        For some reason I could not estabilish a reverse shell so tried different method 
        that one guy from Discord said to me, moving the flag from the root directory to the
        directory from where are files served as static (that way we can access the flag.txt file
        from the browser).
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's now use the SQLi we know that is here with the base-64 encoded string that exploits 
        pickle library at "/view/[number]" route like this:
    </p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/BtsrtSB/image-1.png" alt="payload">

    <p>
        <b>Done!</b> You can now access the flag at this directory [ip addr]:[port]/static/images/flag.txt
    </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            I think, it was really interesting machine, especially for a begginer like me.
            I learned a lot about different types of SQL injections, enumerating the application's 
            source code and also to be patient lol.
