        Since there is no explanation for this challenge, I will do it myself. 
        C.O.P was a pretty simple challenge for an experienced person. For me, 
        it was a little bit hard, but nothing insane. This will be a step by 
        step guide about how I solved this.
    </p>

    <h1>Step 1 - Enumeration</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            First, let's look to Server HTTP header to see if there is some vulnerable version 
            of webserver running on this machine.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9XwByMXk/image.png" alt="logo">
        <p>
            Looking at Snyk's database, it looks like the only vulnerability present in this 
            particular Werkzeug version is with the debug console (which is not enabled). 
            So, we must look somewhere else for the hint. There is source code of this application
            available on the HackTheBox website, so let's look through it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Step 2 - SQLi found</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            It took me about 5 minutes to find this extremely simple SQL injection in the models 
            file by easily escaping the apostrophe. We can influence this variable at the 
            "/view/[number]" route by changing the url path which is used for the ID of a 
            specific product.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/dVcvJLDc/image.png" alt="obrazek">
        <p>
            This will be Boolean-based SQLi, so it will be a little bit slow to crawl through data. 
            You can additionally add a "threads" parameter to enumerate faster, but in our case it's 
            pretty much useless. Let's run the following sqlmap command with an asterisk symbol in 
            the location where the product id should be to represent that this can be injectable.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VN3xmNYb/image.png" alt="obrazek">

        <p>
            Let's run this sqlmap command and look what we have inside this database.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d1wjFmcZ/image.png" alt="sqli">

        <p>
            There are 2 tables present in this one database, the first one contains
            product id, base64 encoded data and created_at timestamp. The second DB is only for
            sqlite to store user data. Nothing here can help us further continue, so the way must
            be somewhere else.
        </p>

    <h1>Step 3 - Python pickle RCE</h1>
    <div>
        <p>As the website content suggests, the the main problem here are "pickles".</p>
        <details>
            <summary>What is python pickle</summary>

            <p>
                A python library for deserializing and serializing data into an object structure. 
                In this case, it is being used to serialize a list.
            </p>
        </details>

        <p>
            Let's take a look at how the application processes data using the pickles library, 
            so that we can fully understand how to attack it.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/sFZ2K98/image.png" alt="template">

        <p>
            We can see that the variable "product" is being processed in the template and piped
            to the "pickle" server-side function. This will be our entry point that we'll attack. 
            The method vulnerable to RCE in pickle is called "loads" (as defined below). 
            This function will decode the base-64 encoded string and then unpack it.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h1>Step 4 - Obtaining the flag</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            In the previous step, I described how I plan to attack the machine. 
            Let's do it now. Here is my python script that I wrote to generate the payload.
        </p>
        <pre>
import pickle
import base64
import os

class Gen(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        # RCE
        script = "mv ./flag.txt /app/application/static/images/flag.txt"
        return os.popen, (script)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pickled = pickle.dumps(Gen())
    print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(pickled))</pre>
    <p>
        For some reason, I could not establish a reverse shell, so I tried a different method 
        that one guy from Discord said to me. I moved the flag from the root directory to the 
        directory from where the files are served as static. That way, we can access the flag.txt 
        file from the browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's now use the SQLi we know that is here with the base-64 encoded string that exploits 
        pickle library at "/view/[number]" route like this:
    </p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/BtsrtSB/image-1.png" alt="payload">

    <p>
        <b>Done!</b> You can now access the flag at this directory [ip addr]:[port]/static/images/flag.txt
    </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            I think the machine was really interesting, especially for a beginner like me. 
            I learned a lot about different types of SQL injections, enumerating the application's 
            source code and also to be patient lol.
